## Foyer

### Enter from Outside

You step into the **Grand Foyer** from the front door. The grand chandelier overhead bathes the room in warm, golden light, its crystals shimmering like a thousand tiny stars. Two curved staircases rise majestically on either side of the foyer, their dark oak banisters polished to perfection. Each step is carpeted in deep crimson, the plush fabric soft underfoot, inviting you to ascend to the mezzanine above. Directly ahead, beneath the mezzanine, are imposing double doors that lead further into the mansion. A richly woven rug, adorned with intricate patterns, spreads out beneath your feet, cushioning your steps as you move through the room. To the right, a door painted in burgundy blends with the dark wood paneling, while on the left, an almost hidden door is tucked into the paneling, subtly revealing a path to another part of the house. Tall, dark wooden bookshelves line the walls, filled with antique volumes and decorative vases, adding to the room's stately atmosphere.

## Guest Bedroom

### Enter from Guest Hallway

You step into the **Guest Bedroom** from the hallway, and the room welcomes you with a sense of understated luxury. The dark oak paneling of the walls adds warmth and richness, while the floor is covered in a thick, deep blue rug that muffles your footsteps. A large, four-poster bed dominates the center of the room, draped in heavy, burgundy curtains with golden tassels. The bed is adorned with a plush comforter and numerous decorative pillows, inviting you to sink into its softness. To the right, two doors lead off into a walk-in wardrobe and a private bathroom. The wardrobe door is made of polished oak, while the bathroom door is painted in a deep green hue, complementing the earthy tones of the room. A tall, narrow window on the far wall is framed by heavy, velvet curtains, through which the storm outside rages on, the rain battering against the glass. A small writing desk with an ornate chair sits by the window, the surface cluttered with an old-fashioned oil lamp, a quill, and a stack of parchment. An armchair, upholstered in a rich, patterned fabric, sits beside the bed, with a small side table holding a vase of fresh flowers.
